"Thanks for your purchase Date:May 16,2002. Email:edum@hkem.com. Dear Sir, I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story here for our story is indeed interwoven with the history of the world and the liberation struggle in the Southern African region of the African continent. The bubble burst just about some weeks ago today when my supreme commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an encounter with the government forces of the MPLA government of my country.The rest is now history but suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at least for the interim period until I am sufficiently sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola. Needles to say I was the single most important commander who was very close to the late supreme commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great deal.The result of such trust is my reason for contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million) with a security/finance company in South Africa.This was immediately after the events of September 11,2001 in the United States of America.Indeed it had become increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money around the world particularly for a liberation movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the money with the security company in South Africa. I have decided to inherit this money which was taken out and deposited with the said security/finance company as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is kept in my signature and would have been used in the purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme commander is dead and as already stated I have decided to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to the fact that other commanders may wish to continue ! I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have been able to establish contact with the company in South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to take possession of the money that I kept with them. Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola (Never as a commander of UNITA). If you are able to cooperate with me over this am willing to give you 20% of the $32million.Please come back to me through email: edum@hkem.com.The security/finance company is standing by to receive my instructions on this and I will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the $32million. Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to state your residential or company address and if possible send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands. Yours truly, Eduado de Mello _______________________________________________ dcms-dev mailing list dcms-dev@eros.cs.jhu.edu",Thanks for your purchase,1,0

"Netflix: Update your billing information Now is the perfect time to visit Costa Rica e map at hazard. Not only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of Borodino to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the position of the Shevardino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shevardino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagration were convinced that the Shevardino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kutuzov himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shevardino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much later, when reports on the battle of Borodino were written at leisure, that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible) that the Shevardino Redoubt was an advanced post--whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank--and that the battle of Borodino was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected, where as it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched.",Netflix: Update your billing information,1,0

"Your payment has failed - update now IGTT Vol. 6, Issue 243 - August 2002 The Wall Street BulletinYour First Source For News From ""The Street"" Symbol: IGTT Shares Outstanding: 373,400,0000 Float (est.): 52,560,000 Short-Term Target: $3.75 52 week High/Low: $1.10/0.02 Rating: Strong Buy Our last pick Symphony Telecom (OTCBB: SYPY) went UP 100% in just one week!!! InDigiNet Identifies Acquisition Targets with Combined Revenues of $35 Million... Â Telecom Consolidation Begins to Accelerate The Wall Street Bulletin believes that the recent investment of capital into Level 3, lead by Warren Buffett, is further proof of the continued validity of the telecommunication market when looked at from the perspective of the small to mid-sized enterprises. After the boom and bust comes the revival. For some carriers drowning in debt, such as Global Crossing and WorldCom, the future may be dim. But for those survivors of the industry that have managed to remain on their feet, other companies' problems mean opportunity. ""Every major industry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm. Christopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few millions."" Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end of this newsletter. As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH. Â Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267 million. IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right for investors to get in on the ground floor. Â The InDigNet Strategy InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious ""Diamond"" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com Â The IT Market Based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including Internet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. Source: IDC Â Particulars The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following reasons: 1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic Committee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University. 3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base. Â Investment Consideration InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars. Â NEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

"Survey: Help us improve I am Mr.IKE EJOH. Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposal for you. On June 6 1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran ch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.Awaiting your urgent reply via my email: Thanks and regards.

"Monthly statement available hello explode your buisiness . . . right now ! this is the break you have been waiting for you do n't want to trash this one warning : this is real ! ! pass this up lightly and you ' ll be making one of the most grave mistakes of your life read this twice ! ! ! ! ! please accept my apology if this was sent to you in error ! you are about to make at least $ 50 , 000 - in less than 90 days read the enclosed program . . . then read it again ! . . . hi , my name is jessy lemieux , and i am the one who sent you this e-mail ( if not , someone i sent this to decided to leave my statement ) . first , let me assure you that this is real . i am a senior in high school in victorville , ca ; just an average person just as you probably are , but am already beginning to become wealthy beyond what i have ever dreamed . i can understand if you dont believe me right now , but i urge you to take a little time to read this and maybe think about it for a few days . that s what i did . i recieved this same e-mail about two months ago . i was skeptical , but after some consideration i decided to go for it . i decided that the $ 20 needed to start was worth risking ( besides if it was a scam i was going to go to the police with the addresses below and get the guy running it busted so that he couldn t rip off anyone else ) . well , to my surprise , i received my reports ( you ll find out about those later ) within two weeks via e-mail . soon i got a po box and a list of two million e-mails ( all very easy ) and started sending emails through a bulk email program i downloaded . everything was easy after that , and the cash was rolling in . and thats my story ( i have no reason to lie to you , my address is below and the last thing i want is hate mail for the rest of my life ) . if you are still concerned , write me and i will answer any questions you have . this truly is the opportunity of a lifetime , don t let it pass you by . sincerely , jessy lemieux pres . w . o . w . incorporated dear friend , the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my fingers . fortunately , sometime later i re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . my name is christopher erickson . two years ago , the corporation i worked at for the past twelve years down-sized and my position was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends , and creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my business and i just could n't seem to make ends meet . i had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . i truly believe it was wrong for me to be in debt like this . at that moment something significant happened in my life and i am writing to share my experience in hopes that this will change your life forever . . . . financially ! ! ! in mid - december , i received this program via email . six months prior to receiving this program i had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . all of the programs i received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . they were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they worked or not . one claimed i 'd make a million dollars in one year . . . it did n't tell me i 'd have to write a book to make it . but like i was saying , in december of ' 96 i received this program . i did n't send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! ! after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it correctly , i could n't believe my eyes . here was a money-making phenomenon . i could invest as much as i wanted to start , without putting me further in debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it out , i would at least get my money back . after determining that the program is legal and not a chain letter , i decided "" why not "" . initially i sent out 10 , 000 emails . it only cost me about $ 15 . 00 for my time on-line . the great thing about email is that i did n't need any money for printing to send out the program , only the cost to fulfill my orders . i am telling you like it is , i hope it does n't turn you off , but i promised myself that i would not "" rip-off "" anyone , no matter how much money it cost me ! . in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report # 1 . by january 13th , i had received 26 orders for report # 1 . when you read the guarantee in the program , you will see that "" you must receive 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 within two weeks . if you don ' t , send out more programs until you do ! "" my first step in making $ 50 , 000 in 20 to 90 days was done . by january 30th , i had received 196 orders for report # 2 . if you go back to the guarantee , "" you must receive 100 or more orders for report # 2 within two weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do . once you have 100 orders , the rest is easy , relax , you will make your $ 50 , 000 goal . "" well , i had 196 orders for report # 2 , 96 more than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 19th , of my emailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car . please take time to read the attached program , it will change your life forever ! remember , it wont work if you do n't try it . this program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it does n't work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money ! report # 2 explains this . always follow the guarantee , 15 to 20 orders for report # 1 , and 100 or more orders for report # 2 and you will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 20 to 90 days . i am living proof that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program , i ' m sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . if you are a fellow business owner and you are in financial trouble like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a sign . i did ! sincerely , christopher erickson ps do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome ! a personal note from the originator of this program by the time you have read the enclosed information and looked over the enclosed program and reports , you should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business for ten years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n't working . finally , i figured it out . it was n't me , it was the economy . inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since 1945 . i do n't have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . as the saying goes , "" the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . "" the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to "" move up "" or "" get rich "" , inflation will see to that . you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a little bit of effort . "" you can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . i should also point out that i will not see a penny of your money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . i have already made over four million dollars ! i have retired from the program after sending out over 16 , 000 programs . now i have several offices which market this and several other programs here in the us and overseas . by the spring , we wish to market the ' internet ' by a partnership with america on line . follow the program exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as it is now . remember to email a copy of this exciting program to everyone that you can think of . one of the people you send this to may send out 50 , 000 . . . and your name will be on every one of them ! . remember though , the more you send out , the more potential customers you will reach . so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , it is up to you now ! "" think about it "" before you delete this program from your mailbox , as i almost did , take a little time to read it and really think about it . get a pencil and figure out what could happen when you participate . figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you will still make a lot of money ! definitely get back what you invested . any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in . it works ! paul johnson , raleigh , nc here ' s how this amazing program will make you $ $ $ $ $ $ let 's say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out 2 , 000 programs each . let 's also assume that the mailing receives a . 5 % response . using a good list the response could be much better . also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out only 2 , 000 programs . with a . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those . 5 % , 100 people respond and order report # 2 . those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000 send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the . 5 % response to that is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that 's 10 , 000 five dollar bills for you . cash ! ! ! ! your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5000 + $ 50 , 000 for a total of $ 55 , 550 ! ! ! ! remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of 2 , 000 people you mail to will do absolutely nothing . . . and trash this program ! dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of only 2 , 000 . believe me , many people will do that and more ! by the way , your cost to participate in this is practically nothing . you obviously already have an internet connection and email is free ! ! ! report # 3 will show you the best methods for bulk emailing and purchasing email lists . this is a legitimate , legal , money making opportunity . it does notrequire you to come in contact with people , do any hard work , and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . if you believe that someday you ' ll get that big break that you ' ve been waiting for , this is it !

! the longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using email . get your piece of this action ! ! multi-level marketing ( mlm ) has finally gained respectability . it is being taught in the harvard business school , and both stanford research and the wall street journal have stated that between 50 % and 65 % of all goods and services will be sold throughout multi - level methods by the mid to late 1990 's . this is a multi - billion dollar industry and of the 500 , 000 millionaires in the us , 20 % ( 100 , 000 ) made their fortune in the last several years in mlm . moreover , statistics show 45 people become millionaires everyday through multi - level marketing . instructions we at m . o . c . marketing business , have a method of raising capital that really works 100 % every time . i am sure that you could use $ 50 , 000 to $ 125 , 000 in the next 20 to 90 days . before you say "" bull "" , please read the program carefully . this is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . basically , this is what we do : as with all multi-level business , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . every state in the usa allows you to recruit new multi - level business partners , and we offer a product for every dollar sent . your orders come and are filled through the mail , so you are not involved in personal selling . you do it privately in your own home , store or office . this is the greatest multi - level mail order marketing anywhere : step ( 1 ) order all four 4 reports listed by name and number . do this by ordering the report from each of the four 4 names listed on the next page . for each report , send $ 5 cash and a self - addressed , stamped envelope ( business size # 10 ) to the person listed for the specific report . international orders should also include $ 1 extra for postage . it is essential that you specify the name and number of the report requested to the person you are ordering from . you will need all four 4 reports because you will be reprinting and reselling them . do not alter the names or sequence other than what the instructions say . important : always provide same-day service on all orders . step ( 2 ) replace the name and address under report # 1 with yours , moving the one that was there down to report # 2 . drop the name and address under report # 2 to report # 3 , moving the one that was there to report # 4 . the name and address that was under report # 4 is dropped from the list and this party is no doubt on the way to the bank . when doing this , make certain you type the names and addresses accurately ! do not mix up moving product / report positions ! ! ! step ( 3 ) having made the required changes in the name list , save it as a text ( . txt ) file in it 's own directory to be used with whatever email program you like . again , report # 3 will tell you the best methods of bulk emailing and acquiring email lists . step ( 4 ) email a copy of the entire program ( all of this is very important ) to everyone whose address you can get your hands on . start with friends and relatives since you can encourage them to take advantage of this fabulous money-making opportunity . that 's what i did . and they love me now , more than ever . then , email to anyone and everyone ! use your imagination ! you can get email addresses from companies on the internet who specialize in email mailing lists . these are very cheap , 100 , 000 addresses for around $ 35 . 00 . important : you won't get a good response if you use an old list , so always request a fresh , new list . you will find out where to purchase these lists when you order the four 4 reports . always provide same-day service on all orders ! ! ! required reports * * * order each report by number and name * * * always send a self-addressed , stamped envelope and $ 5 cash for each order requesting the specific report by name and number you must include your e-mail address _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 1 "" how to make $ 250 , 000 through multi-level sales "" order report # 1 from : w . o . w . incorporated po box 2527 victorville , ca 92393 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 2 "" major corporations and multi-level sales "" order report # 2 from : m - tronics 32445 regents blvd . union city , ca 94587-4849 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 3 "" sources for the best mailing lists "" order report # 3 from rkl international 3060 w . country meadow dr . tucson , az 85742 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ report # 4 "" evaluating multi-level sales plans "" order report # 4 from : thunder tech . 202 lathrop st . south hadley , ma 01075 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ conclusion i am enjoying my fortune that i made by sending out this program . you too , will be making money in 20 to 90 days , if you follow the simple steps outlined in this mailing . to be financially independent is to be free . free to make financial decisions as never before . go into business , get into investments , retire or take a vacation . no longer will a lack of money hold you back . however , very few people reach financial independence , because when opportunity knocks , they choose to ignore it . it is much easier to say "" no "" than "" yes "" , and this is the question that you must answer . will you ignore this amazing opportunity or will you take advantage of it ? if you do nothing , you have indeed missed something and nothing will change . please re-read this material , this is a special opportunity . if you have any questions , please feel free to write to the sender of this information . you will get a prompt and informative reply . my method is simple . i sell thousands of people a product for $ 5 that costs me pennies to produce and email . i should also point out that this program is legal and everyone who participates will make money . this is not a chain letter or pyramid scam . at times you have probably received chain letters , asking you to send money , on faith , but getting nothing in return , no product what-so - ever ! not only are chain letters illegal , but the risk of someone breaking the chain makes them quite unattractive . you are offering a legitimate product to your people . after they purchase the product from you , they reproduce more and resell them . it 's simple free enterprise . as you learned from the enclosed material , the product is a series of four 4 financial and business reports . the information contained in these reports will not only help you in making your participation in this program more rewarding , but will be useful to you in any other business decisions you make in the years ahead . you are also buying the rights to reprint all of the reports , which will be ordered from you by those to whom you mail this program . the concise one and two page reports you will be buying can easily be reproduced ; emailed to the requester . best wishes with the program and good luck ! "" it was truly amazing "" "" not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this program . but conservative as i am , i decided that the initial investment was so little that there was no way that i could not get enough orders to at least get my money back . boy , was i ever surprised when i found my medium sized post office box crammed with orders ! i will make more money this year than any ten years of my life before .

"Q&A session tomorrow Ohne Rezept - kein Potezmit! On that occasion THE KAISER'S MEMOIRS the Prince remarked, in astonishment, Another world, a new world This point of view also showed itself on the occasion of the visit of Admiral von Tirpitz at Friedrichsruh, at the time when he wished to win the old Imperial Chancellor over to favoring the first Navy billBy means of my social legislation I made such conditions im possible in Germany, and I caused it to be intro duced also in Belgium, during the war, by General von Bissing, in order to promote the welfare of the Belgian workersWhen I had finished, the usually very cool and reserved sovereign, who seldom spoke about politics, spontaneously seized my hand, thanked me for this token of my confidence, regretted that I had been brought into such a situation and added, in exactly these wordsJe comprends parfaite- ment ta ligne d'action; le Prince avec toute sa grandeur n'etait apres tout rien d'autre que ton employe ou fonctionnaireIn any event, the Prince now adopted the policy which I had already noted when I realized the dis illusion of the Russians at having stood before the gates of Constantinople without being allowed to enterI have con fidence in youGERMAN SOCIAL PROBLEMS The policy that kept in view the welfare of the workers unquestionably imposed a heavy burden upon all the industrial elements of Germany in the matter of competition in the world market, through the well-known laws for the protection of workingmenThis was shown particu larly whet* the Count asked to go at the same time that his father retiredIt should be borne in mind with what generation I grew up the generation of the devotees of Bis marckAnd &ere we are by the side of that damned French Republic, full of hate for you and of subversive ideas, which, in case of a war against you, will coat us our dynasty, THE KAISER'S MEMUK with French officers, which was increased by the French until it developed into the desire of ven geance by means of armsFURTHER CONFLICT WITH CHANCELLOR The predicted opposition from Prince Bismarck was not long in comingThere new officers were carefully de veloped and trained to independent thinking and action, in accordance with approved principles, and by dint of preserving old traditions and taking into account all that modern times had taught At the Foreign Office there were only executive instruments of a will, who were not informed as to the important interrelationship of the questions turned over to them for treatment, and could not, therefore, collaborate independentlyThe military entourage of the two em perors, as well as the body of officialdom, had grown too oldHere is an example to show the attitude of the Cabinet toward me in those Bismarck days: The question came up of renewing the Socialist law, a political measure devised by Prince Bismarck for fighting socialismIn order to spur them on, I allowed them free rein in their various domainsNeverthless, it stood to reason that I was deeply hurt by what had occurredHerr von Lucanus took over his post from His Excel lency von WilmowskiThis event was a ray of light during the gloomy ninety-nine days, which brought upon me also, as Crown Prince, much grief, humiliation, and suspicionLe moment ou il re- fusait d'agir selon tes ordres, il f allait le renvoyerAs soon as I had recognized the necessity for reforms, to THE KAISER'S MEMOIRS some of which the industrial elements would not consent, I took up the cudgels for the laboring classes, impelled by a sense of justiceThe Prince, who was present during the last hours of the old Emperor and had listened with me to the latter's political testament to his grand son L e his wish as -to the special care to be lavished upon relations with Russia brought about my summer trip to StThis vote showed me once more the domination exerted by the Chancellor over his MinistersHe soon won for himself general ap preciation and affection among the workers and handled them so well that complete quiet reigned in his territoryNever- THE KAISER'S MEMOIRS thclcas, in spite of all this, one could not help being aware of the underlying Centerist conviction that the interests of the Roman Church must always be maintained and never relegated to a secondary placeAs for me, I always distrusted him, and I never believed a word of what he had told me or said to me himself, for I was sure and knew that he was hoaxing me all the timeThe gentlemen there simply flew when they were summoned or dismissed by the Count, so much so that a joking saying arose at the time that their coat tails stood straight out behind themThe foreign policy was conducted and dictated by Prince Bismarck alone, after consultation with Count Herbert, who passed on the commands of the Chancellor and had them transformed into instructionsThe state, he believed, should care for the laborer, as much and in whatever manner it deemed proper ; he would not admit of any co-operation of the workers in thisThe Free Thinkers, under the unswerving leader, entered into no relations with me ; they lim ited themselves to opposition",Q&A session tomorrow,1,0

"Welcome to Microsoft In 1957, a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha. In the midst of the move one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha. Concerned about damaging the idol, the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task. When night came, one of the monks came to check on the giant statue. He shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha. When he reached the crack he saw something reflected back at him. The monk, his curiosity aroused, got a hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha. As he knocked off piece after piece of clay, the Buddha got brighter and brighter. After hours of work, the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before him a huge solid-gold Buddha.Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army. They covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen. In the attack all the monks were killed, so it wasn't until 1957, when the monks were moving the giant statue, that the great treasure was discovered. Like the Buddha, our outer shell protects us from the word: our real treasure is hidden within. We human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay. All we need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our outer shell, piece by piece.Could you be sitting on your own gold mine? Did you know the average American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income? Then, why don't they? It's simple. They haven't been taught that they could. They are taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money work for them. They pay too much in taxes. They are wasting money every month and don't even realize it. In short, they are financially unhealthy.

heed in its outward form to the close relationship between a grandson and his grandmother, who had carried him in her arms when he was a baby and, in view of her age alone, commanded great respect but, in its essentials, it laid stress upon the position and duty of the German Emperor, compelled to carry out uncon- BISMARCK ditionally a command of his dying father affecting Germany's most vital interestsGERMAN SOCIAL PROBLEMS The policy that kept in view the welfare of the workers unquestionably imposed a heavy burden upon all the industrial elements of Germany in the matter of competition in the world market, through the well-known laws for the protection of workingmenIn order to spur them on, I allowed them free rein in their various domainsThis generation, through its dealings with Crown Prince Frederick William, was imbued with many liberal ideas and projects of reform which were to be carried out under the direction of the Emperor FrederickIt stated that the grandson was obliged to respect this command of his grandfather in the interest of the country, the representation of which interests had now devolved upon him by the will of God, and that his royal grandmother must leave to him the question of deciding in what manner this was to be doneBismarck would turn over in his grave if he could know at what time the third volume appeared, and what consequences it had* I should be honestly grieved if the third volume had damaged the memory of the great Chancel lor, because Bismarck is one of the heroic figures whom the 'German people need for their regener ationWhat he wished occurredThis afforded me and filled up my whole lifeThe Center party was welded together by the Kulturkampf and was strongly anti-Protestant and hostile to the EmpireThe ambassador replied that the same thing had also occurred to him and caused him to have the earlier records of the Embassy investigated, whereupon it had transpired that the Embassy had sent the full est reports on the subject to London and that thor ough reports had been for! warded h ome concerning every important stage in the progress of social re form; but, because they came from Germany, nobody ever read them ; they were simply pigeon holed and remained there ever since ; it is a down right shame ; Germany does not interest people at home/ Thus the Briton, with a shrug of his shouldersSpurred on by the captivating discourses of Achen bach, I derived from this period of my life a special interest in the economic side of the inner development of the country, whereas the purely judicial side of the administration interested me to a lesser degree THE KAISER'S MEMOIRS The Foreign Office was conducted with the strictest discipline by Count Herbert, whose rude ness toward his employees particularly struck meThis afforded me and filled up my whole lifeThis was in contrast to the General Staff under MoltkeBut it turned out that this was BISMARCK hardly possible so long as Prince Bismarck re mained in office, since he reserved for himself the main deciding voice in everything, thereby im pairing the independence of those working with himTo sum up my conversations with the Tsar, the following remark by him is of importanceIf BISMARCK I wish to have Constantinople, I shall take it when ever I feel like it, without need of permission or approval from Prince BismarckAfter this hide refusal of the Bismarck offer of Constantinople, I looked upon my mission as a failure and made my report to the Prince accordinglyBut I always held aloof",Invoice #754244 - Payment required,1,0

In time of peace also, for which the canal was des tined, it would have been most beneficialIn the east, great extensions of railway stations, bridges, and new railway lines were built, some of them while the war was in progressWith the co-operation and collaboration of the Empress Frederick, projects and plans were made, and, finally, a big model was provided by Building Councilor Inne the modern Schlxitef, as the Empress Frederick used to call him which won unanimous approvalFor the second time he offered me his resignation ; I did not accept it, but sought to console himIn the first half of came the sending of Sir Ernest Cassel with a verbal note in which Eng land offered to remain neutral in case of an un provoked attack upon Germany, provided Ger many agreed to limit her naval construction pro gram and to drop her new Naval bill, the latter being darkly hinted atThe custom of vendetta is an ancient one, sanc tified by tradition, which is no less true of robbery and cattle stealingBallin fetched Cassel, who handed me a docu ment which, he stated, had been prepared with the approval and knowledge of the English Govern mentI read the short note through and was not a little surprised to see that I was holding in my hand a formal offer of neutrality in case Germany became involved in future warlike complications, conditioned upon certain limitations in the carry ing out of our program of naval construction, which were to be the subject of mutual confer ences and agreementsSELECTION OF CHURCHILL After a while, however, it was decided that it was more fitting to Grey's personal and official im portance to appear only at the termination of the negotiations, to affix his name to the agreement, and as it was put in the information transmitted from England to Ballin to get his dinner from the Emperor and to come in for his part of the festivities and fireworks which, in good Ger man, means to enjoy the Bengal light illuminationAs it had been decided that Churchill was not to get this in any event, it was necessary to choose somebody for the negotiations who was close to Asquith and Grey and who, possessing their com plete confidence, was willing to conduct the nego tiations as far as the beginning of the fireworks ; one who, moreover, was already known at Berlin and not a stranger in GermanyTherein his services toward forming a regular General Staff and preparing the British % THE KAISER'S MEMOIRS army for the World War are placed in a bright light and emphasis is laid on the skill with which he utilized the permission obtained from the Prussian War Ministry in order to learn in Germany about military matters and to reorgan ize the British army and General Staff, to the minutest detail and on the German model, for the coming war against the erstwhile German hostsMore over, at my special suggestion, a through line was built from Giessen to Wiesbaden, which included reconstruction of the stations at Homburg and MY CO-WORKERS Wiesbaden and the building of a loop around Frankfort and HSchst In addition, trains were provided with through cars from Flushing to the TaunusI felt no particular inclination toward the lawyers in themselves since pedantry, remote ness from actualities and doctrinaire leanings often assert themselves in the domain of the law altogether too much for my taste but the com pilation of the Citizens* Law Book interested me greatlyI described to him the entire course of the affair and the disputes in Berlin as to the introduction or nonintroduc- tion of the bill, and asked him then to tell me, with his usual complete frankness, what he thought the right thing to do in the interest of the national welfare, since I greatly desired to hear an objec tive opinion, uninfluenced by the rival camps of BerlinI asked him if he thought that the French BETHMANN methods were still in accordance with the Alge- ciras AgreementFrom the start I concerned myself with the completion of the railway systemSince the railways were considered a na tional pocketboofc, there was a desire to build only paying lines, which caused prejudice against outlays for military lines designed for the defense of the fatherland, since it diminished the fine surplus funds by which such great store was laidA man of iron energy and unflagging capacity for work and joyousness ;

"IRS: You have a tax refund pending Dear Sir,My name is Mr. Obi W, the manager, credit and foreign bills of Eco Bank Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash [Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6, 1997.Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million five hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than five years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal after realizing that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will give you 25% of the total.Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication.Respectfully submitted,Obi W.",IRS: You have a tax refund pending,1,0

"Office closed for holiday *** PLEASE READ THIS EMAIL TO THE END *** Â Try it. Just for fun. It will cost you 25$ to earn at least thousands of dollars !!! This thing is legal because you are buying and selling something of value: marketing reports. Â There is MY true story. Â I received by email the instructions include in this letter. It interests me because the system was quite simple. In the list of people selling the reports (as you will see above), there was a guy living not so far. I searched for his phone number and I called him. I just wanted to know if this system was really working. He told me his business was going very well and he was receiving from 50$ to 150$ in CASH everyday! That's why I went into this thing! Â Â THANK'S TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ========================================= BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Â Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal. Â Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can ""follow the simple instruction"" they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost''. Â == PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE == $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Â If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following... THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!! Â $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Â FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED! Â INSTRUCTIONS: Â =====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below ===== Â For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems. Â ===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === Â You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. Â YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00. Â Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer. Â IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in step '' 1 through 6 '' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Â Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! Â This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time. Â 1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune. Â 2..Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. Â 3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. Â 4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. Â 5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 Â 6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. Â PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success. Â Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Â Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going: Â METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ========================================= Â Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%). Also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each). Â Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e- mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and ordered Report # 2. Â Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. Â Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 5 million e-mail sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4. Â Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000(50 million) e- mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5. Â Â THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars). Â Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total = $555,550.00 Â NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ========================================= Â REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more? Â There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming on line every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! Â METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ========================================= Â Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD #2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders. Â This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report. Â =========== AVAILABLE REPORTS ============== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you. Â ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. Â PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : =========================================REPORT # 1: 'The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net Â Order Report #1 from: Y.L.Wong P.O. Box NO. 71819 Kowloon Central Post Office Hong Kong __________________________________________________ Â REPORT # 2: The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net Â Order Report # 2 from: Martin Veronneau C.P. 70058 Laval, Quebec H7R 5Z2 Canada__________________________________________________ Â REPORT # 3: Secret To Multilevel Marketing On The Net Â Order Report # 3 from: Francis Kidd P.O.

Pearl, Suite G103 Dallas, TX 75201 USA Â Â __________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$ Â Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success: Â === If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. Â === After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do. Â **Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. Â You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business!!! ========================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now. Â Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Â Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent. Â IT IS UP TO YOU NOW! Â =============TESTIMONIALS=============== ''My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old ''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Â Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00......... all cash! I was shocked. I have joined Jodyin her ''hobby''. Â Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois ========================================= ''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan. But conservative as I am, I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back. I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. Â The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't a better investment with a faster return and so big''. Â Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada ========================================= ''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the money came within 22 weeks''. Â Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y. ========================================= ''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made $20, in the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanx to internet''.

"Your password will expire in 24 hours INVESTMENT SCHOLARS CLUB- bringing you the latest from the financial epicenter. Research Alert - Undervalued August 26, 2002 XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) Alert Rating = 8Congratulations to our subscribers who moved in fast on our last report! Pick #1 - Internet incubator giant CMGI has paid off very well, up over 150% on major volume and great news.Pick #2 - ENBC Began its' heavy move up over 200% hitting a high of over 300%... Our Latest Discovery: XRMD - Several investment reporters featured XrayMedia during fiscal 2001/02. At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company's direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing itsÂ’ technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, weÂ’ve never seen anything like it!How does the company do this? XrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a ""mass source to advertising sector "" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the companyÂ’sÂ’ strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the usersÂ’ criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. Their ""source to business model"", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.While investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon. *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. *** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. *** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings ""substantially"" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.

"Your payment has failed - update now Dear Sir,I am Stanley Woodwork, the secetary of Africa White farmers co-operation (AWFC) OF Zimbabwe. After the last general elections in my country where the incumbent president Mr. Robert Mugabe won the presidential election, the government has adopted a very aggressive land reforms programme. This programme is solely aimed at taking the land owned by white African farmers for redistribution to black africans. This programme has attracted worldwide condemnation from world leaders including British prime minister,mr Tony Blair and also forced several white farmers to flee the country for fear of victimization and physical abuse. Two weeks ago, our headquartes in Harare was attacked and looted by black protesters and in the process burnt down the whole building. Fortunately,they did not get access to the huge funds kept in the strong room which belong to the co-operation. This cash was kept at the secretariat rather than in the bank for fear of seizure by the government. Now I have the funds in my possession and would need to get it invested in a viable business venture in europe. The cash in question is US$46Million dollars. Once I can get your commitment and sincerity of investing this funds on our behalf then I would proceed to get the funds freighted to Europe, where you would be required to pick it up for investment for us. You do not have anything to worry about as I would undertake all charges involved in freighting the funds to europe, and the business proposal is 100% legal and risk free. You would be adequately compensated for all your effort once we have gotten the funds to europe. Please get back to me if you can be of assistance and I would want our correspondence to be via email as most phone lines of white farmers are bugged by the government. I expect 100% confidentiality and your prompt response to this mail so as to proceed.you may also reach me on stanleywoodwork@email.com Kind regards,Stanley Woodwork.",Your payment has failed - update now,1,0

He was far too great a statesman to mistake the importance of the labor question to the stateLater on I spoke often with the Prince about the colonial question and always found in him the intention to utilize the colonies as commercial ob jects, or objects for swapping purposes, other than to make them useful to the fatherland or utilize them as sources of raw materialsHANDLING A COAL STJUKE The great Westphalian coal workers* strike in the spring of took the civil administration by surprise, causing great confusion and bewilder ment, especially among members of the Westpha- pfcrtrineial administrationHe spoke about family dictation in Eng land, of interference from that quarter which must cease; the tone of the letter showed, he said, how the Crown Prince and Emperor Frederick had been ordered about and influenced by his mother-in-law, wife, etcInstead! , I cont inued, the Treaty of San Stefano was forced upon the Russians and they were com pelled to turn about at the very gates of the city which they had reached and saw before them, after frightful battles and hardshipsIn addition, there was the entourage of Emperor Frederick IIL I pro ceeded to dismiss, in the friendliest way, all those gentlemen who wished to go into retirement ; some of than received positions in the army, a few of BISMARCK the younger remained in my service for the tran sition periodIn addition, there was the entourage of Emperor Frederick IIL I pro ceeded to dismiss, in the friendliest way, all those gentlemen who wished to go into retirement ; some of than received positions in the army, a few of BISMARCK the younger remained in my service for the tran sition periodI won the confidence of the Prince, who con- BISMARCK suited me about many thingsRELIEF AT CHANCELLOR'S DISMISSAL In , at the Narva maneuvers, I was obliged to describe minutely to the Tsar the retirement of Prince BismarckThis meant all the more since my statements could not have been agreeable to my grandfather and the Chancellor",Calendar invite for ReviewMeeting,1,0

"Your report is ready Herzlich Willkommen! e.He soon won for himself general ap preciation and affection among the workers and handled them so well that complete quiet reigned in his territoryIn like manner, the fact that Bismarck was called the majordomo of the Hohenzollerns could not shake my trust in the Prince, although he, per haps, had thoughts of a political tradition for his familyFor instance, when the Prince brought about the first German colonial acquisitions (Gross and Klein Popo, Togo, etc.), I informed him, at his wish, concerning the state of mind created in the public and the navy by this move, and described to him the enthusiasm with which the German people had hailed the new roadBut my reverence for Bismarck, the great statesman, remained unalteredHe could be a very gay companion and knew how to assemble interesting men around his table, partly from the Foreign Office, partly from other circlesSwitzerland was contemplating something similar, and had thought of convening a congress at BerneThe realization of this, which was confirmed in me when I questioned my former private teacher, Privy Councilor DrA certain paragraph therein was to be toned down, in order to save the law, * THE KAISER'S MEMOIRS Bismarck opposed the changeSpurred on by the captivating discourses of Achen bach, I derived from this period of my life a special interest in the economic side of the inner development of the country, whereas the purely judicial side of the administration interested me to a lesser degreeFURTHER CONFLICT WITH CHANCELLOR The predicted opposition from Prince Bismarck was not long in comingFURTHER CONFLICT WITH CHANCELLOR The predicted opposition from Prince Bismarck was not long in comingWhen I had finished, the usually very cool and reserved sovereign, who seldom spoke about politics, spontaneously seized my hand, thanked me for this token of my confidence, regretted that I had been brought into such a situation and added, in exactly these wordsJe comprends parfaite- ment ta ligne d'action; le Prince avec toute sa grandeur n'etait apres tout rien d'autre que ton employe ou fonctionnaireIn like manner, the fact that Bismarck was called the majordomo of the Hohenzollerns could not shake my trust in the Prince, although he, per haps, had thoughts of a political tradition for his familyAs was my duty, I called the Prince's attention to the fact that mer chants and capitalists were beginning energet ically to develop the colonies and that, therefore as I had learned from Hanseatic circles they counted upon protection from a navyOnly the small group of old generals, especially those at the Russian court, who dated from the days of Alexander II, and who knew and esteemed Emperor William the Great, still showed their reverence for him and their friendly feeling to ward GermanyI said that it was my duty to take care of those Germans who were used up by industry, to protect their strength and better their chances of existenceOn the contrary!

I currently have within my reach the sum of THIRTY FIVE MILLION US Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment, like Real Estate Development or import/export business specifically in your country. This money came as a payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant Project.

In view of these, l acted fast to withdraw the US$3! 5,000,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited in another private security company vault within the country. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the Russian. Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this money within.

And therein lies the weakness in the superi ority of great menUpon asking the Prince the reason why he held such an unfavorable opinion, he answered that Count Herbert had reported very disapprovingly on TurkeyThat trick, added the Emperor, was beyond his own powersThese were the first and last troops seen by Frederick III as Em perorThe assemblage proceeded to take up its work again and turned out a wealth of material for the extension of that social legislation called into being by Emperor William the Great, which is the pride of Germany, evincing, as it does, a protective attitude toward the laboring classes such as is not to be found in any other land on earthMy parents were not very friendly toward Prince Bis marck and looked with disfavor upon the fact that their son had entered into the Prince's circleIn the THE KAISER'S MEMOIRS course of thetc, Herr von Benda held my attention by means of his independent, interesting judgment I accepted with pleasure an invitation to Benda's country seat, Rudow, near Berlin, and from this arose the custom of a regular yearly visit The hours spent in the family circle at Rudow stand out pleasantly in my memoryA serious mistake on the part of the Chancellor), when he speaks, in the chapter about Botticher, of the oldish caution of the Chancellor, and of Jlje young EmperorFor this reason I avoided, while I was Prince of Prussia, all attempts to drag me into party activitiesIn spite of the failure of my mission I found calm judgments of the political situationAgitation and rebellion, he believed, should be severely sup pressed ; by force of arms, if necessaryThere were sharp differences of opinionThen came the labor-protective legislationI real ized clearly that it was impossible for one human being to make a nation happyHe discharged his duties admirably and, being well endowed in all per taining to art, technical matters, science, and pol itics, he was to me a counselor, untiring collabo rator, and friendThat was the soil in which, later, the World War ambitions of our foes found nourishment Revanche pour Sedan, combined with Revanche pour San StefanoThe words of the old General at Brest have re mained unforgettably engraved upon my memory ; they induced me to bring about my many meetings with Alexander III and Nicholas II, at which my grandfather's wish, impressed upon me on his deathbed, that I watch over our relations with Russia, has always been my guiding motiveAt the opening session the Chancellor unex pectedly appearedI, however, wished to win over the soul of the German workingman, and I fought zealously to attain this goalThese were the first and last troops seen by Frederick III as Em perorWhen Tsar Nicholas II, he who has been mur dered, came of age, I was assigned at the instiga tion of Prince Bismarck to confer upon the heir- apparent at St Petersburg the Order of the Black EagleOn the con trary, I received direct instructions to offer Russia Constantinople and the Dardanelles (in other words, San Stef ano and the Berlin Treaty had been dropped!) Improvements, canal construc tion, highway building, forestry, improvement in all kinds of transportation facilities, betterment of dwellings, introduction of machines into agri culture and their co-operative development all of these were matters with which I busied myself later on; this being especially true of hydraulic work and the development of the network of rail ways, particularly in the badly neglected territory of Eastern GermanyThis was especially true in relation to an industrial system lil^e the Belgian, which could, without hindrance, squeeze the last drop out of the human reserves of Belgium and pay * BISMARCK low wages, without feeling any pangs of con science or compassion for the sinking morale of the exhausted, unprotected peopleI summoned a Crown CouncilPROPHECY OP RUSSIAN DOWNFALL At Brest-Litovsk, in the course of the constant military preparations of all kinds, I could easily see that the conduct of the Russian officers toward me was essentially cooler and haughtier than on the occasion of my first visit to St",New comment on your post,1,0

What the heck."" Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not.

This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity.

To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it.

MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.

Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits.

This is critical to YOUR success.================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net""Order Report #: 1 from Rui Sousa Santos P.O.

Box 19 52 Victoria Drive London SW19 6BD United Kingdom ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses.

"Weekly team sync notes HelloYou may have seen this business before and ignored it. I know I did - many times! However, please take a few moments to read this letter. I was amazed when the profit potential of this business finally sunk in... and it works!With easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail, success in this business is now fast, easy and well within the capabilities of ordinary people who know little about internet marketing. And the earnings potential is truly staggering!I'll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! - follow what it says to the letter - and you will not worry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is President, or whether you keep your current job or not. Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded to one of these before either. One day though, something just said: ""You throw away $25.00 going to a movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck."" Believe me, no matter where you believe those ""feelings"" come from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. I cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing had I not. Read on. It's true. Every word of it. It is legal. I checked. Simply because you are buying and selling something of value.AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:Making over half a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET! ================================================== BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!Before you say ""Bull"", please read the following. This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal.Their findings proved once and for all that there are ""absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can 'follow the simple instructions' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25 out of pocket cost"".DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.This is what one had to say: ""Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in.""Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. ================================================== Another said: ""This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything.""More testimonials later but first, =========== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ==== $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$If you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$FOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!INSTRUCTIONS:=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====For each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE === ===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! === You will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.Within a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the 1,000's of people who will order them from you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer.IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is instructed below in steps 1 through 6 or you will lose out on the majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see how it will not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their friends'/relatives' names on all five thinking they could get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, some have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!! This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time.1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.2.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5.3.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4.4.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3.5.. Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 26.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position.PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! This is critical to YOUR success.================================================== **** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.Save this on a disk as well just in case you lose any data. To assist you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more. There are 2 primary methods to get this venture going:METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY ==================================================Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will assume you and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better but let's just say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only 5,000 each.Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's 100 people who responded and ordered Report # 2.Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.Those 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report # 5.THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00 (half a million dollars).Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY! ==================================================REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000 e-mails each or more?There are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting, with thousands more coming online every day. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more!METHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET ==================================================Advertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same day service on all orders.This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and address on it, will be prompt because they cannot advertise until they receive the report.===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ==================== The reason for the ""cash"" is not because this is illegal or somehow ""wrong"". It is simply about time. Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you.ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address.PLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : ================================================== REPORT # 1: ""The Insider's Guide To Advertising for Free On The Net""Order Report #: 1 from Rui Sousa Santos P.O. Box 132 Taylors Lakes VIC 3038 Australia ______________________________________________________REPORT # 2: ""The Insider's Guide To Sending Bulk Email On The Net""Order Report # 2 from: Richard Moulton P.O.

Box 19 52 Victoria Drive London SW19 6BD United Kingdom ______________________________________________________ $$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$Follow these guidelines to guarantee your success:=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails until you do.=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do.** Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a different report.You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! ================================================= FOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works exceedingly well as it is now.Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as instructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. Remember though, the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach. So my friend, I have given you the ideas, information, materials and opportunity to become financially independent.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW !=============MORE TESTIMONIALS=============== ""My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving 'junk mail'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved. I 'knew' it wouldn't work. Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old 'I told you so' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she had received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash! I was shocked.

Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire where he deposited One Iron Box containing USD$ 22 million dollars cash (Twenty Two Million dollars).This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my FATHER and he have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family before his arrest.Thereafter, I rushed down to Abidjan with these documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my father. Also, I have been granted political stay as a Refugee by the Government of Cï¿½te d'Ivoire.Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money from Cï¿½te d'Ivoire immediately for investment .

"Newsletter for August fork ,From;Mr.David Kargbou and Family, Johannesburg,South Africa.My Dear ,Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes. My name is Mr.David Kargbou,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbou,of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the la st undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood. During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and bloc ked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office. 2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.Best Regards, Mr.David Kargbou and family.",Newsletter for August,1,0

""Every major industry in the history of the United States has experienced a similar transformation, from the railroads in the late 1800s to the automakers in the mid-1900s to the Dot-Coms at the end of the 20th century,"" says Robert Saunders, director of the Eastern Management Group market research firm. Christopher Dean, CTO of OSS company Eftia, says ""We are seeing all the people that are the survivors. There's all this pent-up money and for the surviving carriers out there, they can get what used to cost a few billion for a few millions."" Read the full story from Telecommunications Magazine - See the link at the end of this newsletter. As we write this report, our New Recommendation InDigiNet, Inc. (OTCBB: IGTT) has only been trading on the OTC Bulletin Board since late May of 2002. As InDigiNet, Inc. continues to implement its business plan, we believe this company will help lead the way up for the resurgence of the Telecom Sector. This could be our strongest recommendation of the year. We are giving IGTT our Highest Rating of STRONG BUY/AGGRESSIVE GROWTH. Â Ground Floor Opportunity / Tremendous Growth Potential We believe IGTT will perform equally to, if not greater than its competition. A similar telecommunications company, Talk America Holdings (Nasdaq: TALK), share price began to explode in April of this year moving from just over $0.40/share to over $4.00/share in late June. Talk America Holdings previously had a market cap of only $24.51 million, but today has a market cap of $267 million. IGTT curently has a market cap of $22.42 million. Using the TALK model for potential growth, IGTT could very well be trading in the .60 range in only a few months, with a market cap in excess of $250 million. This would be an increase of 1000%. So you see why IGTT has such great potential and the time is right for investors to get in on the ground floor. Â The InDigNet Strategy InDigiNet, Inc. is an integrated solutions company that provides small to mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) with an integrated communication solution. InDigiNet is a prestigious ""Diamond"" level partner of Avaya, as well as a reseller for Cisco and Compaq. The Company will offer data, local, long distance and wireless services to SMEs over third party networks enabling the Company to offer a comprehensive suite of services without the capital burden of building a communication network. The Companyâ€™s strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company recently completed its acquisitions of Fox Telecommunications and WBConnect. InDigiNet will then expand the breadth of their services to grow revenue and enhance profitability. SMEs account for $120 billion in commercial telephony, data services and technology spending, or 33% of the countryâ€™s total market, and this spending is expected to grow at above average rates over the next ten years. Source: Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. The IGTT web site: www.indiginet.com Â The IT Market Based on recent studies, the countryâ€™s 7.4 million SMEs currently lag significantly in the utilization of IT and data communications, including Internet access, web services, business software and e-commerce. Worldwide IT spending increased to $981 billion US for the year, an overall increase of 3.7 percent over 2001, according to a study released 7/24/2002 by market researcher IDC. IT spending in 2003 is expected to reach record heights, growing by 9 percent worldwide to top the $1 trillion mark for the first time. In IDC's revised forecasts for IT spending in 2002 and 2003, IT spending in the US is expected to increase by 3 percent this year over 2001 to $436 billion, with further growth of 9 percent in 2003. Western Europe can expect growth of 4 percent in 2002 and 6 percent in 2003. Though Japan will experience flat growth levels this year, by next year growth in the market will return to the tune of 7 percent with particular strength shown in China, India, Korea, Russia, the Philippines, South Africa and Poland. Source: IDC Â Particulars The Wall Street Bulletin is putting IGTT on our Strong Buy/Aggressive Growth recommendation list for the following reasons: 1. The Company's strategy is to acquire the customer bases of smaller, single-market communication companies and attractively priced Internet Service Providers (ISPs). The Company will sell its bundled service package to the acquired customer base that will form a direct and immediate distribution channel for all types of communication services - local, long distance, wireless, and data. 2. The Company is currently serving many customers in the Denver/Front Range communities but in particular the education vertical market has recognized the value of integrating a wireless broadband data network into the existing campus network. The Company's customers include United States Olympic Committee (USOC), University of Denver, and Colorado State University. 3. The Company has identified approximately $35,000,000 in revenues to acquire comprised of distressed assets to be auctioned in bankruptcy court and smaller communication providers with valuable customer bases. Each of the targeted companies are within the Company's footprint and will, subject to purchase completion, increase the Company's embedded customer base. Â Investment Consideration InDigiNet Inc recently filed its 10QSB, for the three months ended March 31, 2002. IGTT reported Revenues of $339,694 in Q1 2002 vs. Revenues of $0 in Q1 2001. At this current growth rate, revenues should grow above $1.3 million for their first year of production with no increases in acquisitions. As more and more large corporations come under government scrutiny, investors will turn to small to mid-sized companies with their investment dollars. Â NEWS - InDigiNet, Inc.

"Warning: Your email will be deleted rent, Baseball and Marketing. Thu, August 7, 2008 Hi rent, Yesterday, I learned yet another life's little lesson while playing catch with my son, Adam (age 7). I don't play baseball, but a good friend and business associate Jason Gonzalas, who is passionate about the game -- taught me a lesson and taught my son how to catch. While he was throwing the ball, he noticed that Adam was having trouble catching and was getting increasingly frustrated. When Jason threw the ball - Adam focused on the gloves he was wearing, instead of the ball coming at him. Then Jason said something that got Adam to catch better -- and made me think. He said... ""Take your eye off that ball, and you LOSE the whole ballgame."" The ""ball"" is top of consciousness positioning, and if you take your eye off that ball, you lose the whole ballgame. Within 30 minutes of playing catch -- Adam caught 7 out of every 10 throws coming at him. The lesson I learned here was simple and basic, but one that most of us forget to apply in life's situations. When building your Internet Business -- Keep your eye on the results you desire (the ball) -- The results MUST be the top of consciouness positioning. In most businesses, PROFIT and cash-flow is the RESULT! And Marketing is the way to accomplish those results. Out of sight, out of mind, out of money.

"Verify your account immediately Aren't Asian Pacfic Americans (APAs) accorded equal opportunity already? Unfortunately, no. APAs are not accorded equal opportunity in workplaces presently. Equal opportunity means: ""For every man, woman and child to go as far and rise as high as their ambition and ability will take them."" Statistics, mostly gathered by government studies, show that AAs have only 1/3 the opportunity of all other Americans to rise to the top in the academic world, corporate world, the federal government. There seems to exist an invisible resistance to AAs' developing to the maximal of their potentials -- A Glass Ceiling. Let's look at a concrete case. A lot of our best people are employed in universities. Their average performance has been outstanding. What's their chance of rising to the top? University administrators are recruited almost exclusively from the ranks of faculty and professionals already employed in universities. Hence the ratio of [administrators / (faculty + professionals)], broken down to races, is a measure of the opportunity enjoyed by American citizens of different races. Nationwide, that ratio for blacks (non-Hispanic) is 0.21. That is, for every 100 black faculty and professionals there are 21 black administrators. The ratio for Native American is 0.20; for white (non-Hispanic) is 0.16; and for Hispanic is 0.15. However, it is only 0.06 for Asian American. Get on the Web and check it out for yourself! Source: Dept. of Education - , Table B-1f. The above dismal picture emerges from the supposedly ""enlightened"" academic world. The situation in the corporate world, state and federal governments is worse. In E-Mail 2 & 3, we present a strategy to induce the two major political parties to help us fight for equal opportunity and help make our beloved nation ""a more perfect Union."" There has already been progress on account of that strategy. Behold how the glass ceiling in the federal government is being shattered, owing significantly to the bloc-vote organized and delivered by 80-20 in the 2000 election.

Volume:Â Â Â Â 47,940Approx. Float:Â Â 5 MillionInsider & Institutional Holdings:92% SharesÂ Â Â "" CXIN MEDIA CORPORATION, THE BLOOMBERG OF CHINA."" - Finance and Investment Magazine, December 2001Â THE COMPANY:CXIN Media Corporation is an integrated media company focusing on the dissemination and aggregation of information. Currently, CXINs core business is in the publishing and aggregation of Financial, Economic, and Business Information on the Peoples Republic of China. The value CXIN Media provides is its ability to source, package, and present information that is highly in demand by the market.Apart from the core print and electronic publishing business, CXIN is involved in other related businesses, such as organizing and managing events such as conferences, seminars, and training in the field of wealth management and personal finance.These areas are closely linked to the core competencies of the company and they intend to leverage on the brands that they have built to further drive the growth potential.CXIN holds the key to success in the Peoples Republic of China. In May of 2001 they acquired the 12 year exclusive right from the China Economic Information Network, a corporation under the direct management of the State Information Center and the State Planning Development Commission, Chinas highest economic decision body.HIGHLIGHTS:May 2001, CXIN acquires the 12 year Exclusive license to distribute all information in English, French and Spanish, Internationally.February 2002, CXIN announced its first distribution contract with a leading market research provider.March 2002, CXIN announces it had signed with yet another distributor for its unique financial , economic and business information on the Peoples Republic of China.Â May 7, 2002, CXIN announces a distribution agreement with Internet Securities, a Euromarket company and the leading provider of emerging market securities.May 9, 2002, CXIN announces it had hired one of Asias top media consulting firms, Telesis, and its President, Mr. Cyril Pereira, the former Director of Operation of the South China Morning Post and Asia Magazine.June 12, 2002, CXIN launched its China Business portal and began selling subscriptions.June 24, 2002, CXIN announces the acquisition ofÂ Smart Investor Magazine and related business. This magazine will bring over $1.2 Million in consolidated revenues.Â July 15, 2002, CXIN announces the license agreement with Lexis-Nexis, one of the worlds largest aggregators.INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS:According to the reports from Morgan-Stanley, which analyzes the worlds superpowers in 11 industries, it only takes 8 years to build a media empire, which means the return on investment in this industry will be far greater than that of pharmaceutical, household merchandise, energy, or even banking. We believe that CXIN Media is well positioned to become the next superpower of the media market in the fast growing Chinese market. The superior management and its exclusive agreement granted by the Chinese government provide the company with an ""unfair advantage"" over its potential competitors. We believe that the recent license agreements signed with some of the largest information providers in the world as well as the Smart Investor Magazines and related business will enable the company to meet its revenue and profit expectation of $50 Million within the next 5 years and dependent on market condition for refinancing, we foresee that CXIN Media could easily double their expected revenue and profits through strategic acquisitions. The current price of the shares do not reflect the value of this growth company, in comparison to the sector CXIN Media should be currently trading between $0.25 to $0.50 and above this value when we take into consideration the growth factors.Disclaimer: The Wall Street Weekly provides information on selected companies that it believes has investment potential.

"Act now: Limited time offer Selling Travel in Today's EconomyGood morning! Â Since it may have been awhile since you visited us atÂ www.mailpound.comÂ I wanted to update you on what is happening. When we launched the MailPound almost two years ago, our focus was on saving ""Time, Toner and Trees""Â by providing an alternative forÂ organizing the huge number of faxes suppliers sent travel agents each week. Our most popular feature was the FAM section, followed by the Weekly Sweepstakes. Â But that has changed. Â Like many involved in selling retail travel, we have been striving to find ways to succeed in a challenging environment. Additional commission cuts, the aftermath of 9/11, and the drop in the stock market, has had a cumulative effect on all of us. To survive, to succeed, we know that we will need to work harder, work smarter, and work together. We have gotten a tremendous amount of support from travel agents and this has translated into the ability to get more support for travel agents from suppliers. Â Our focus has expanded from providing a resource for searching supplier Special Offers to providing a suite of tools and services that can create sales and raise commissions. Almost all of these services are supplier supported and FREE to travel agents. Actively seek out the bestÂ e-commerce values HelpÂ you market Special Offers to your clients Host personal web sites for travel agents with MailPound content* OfferÂ higher commissions through consolidation Organize sales incentives from suppliers Provide new technology for fast and easyÂ online bookings Provide your clients with the ability to book through you, online *Â MPdirect services are offered for $9.95/month Â We invite you to visit us soon at www.mailpound.comÂ or check out the links shown below. See how the FREE services we offer the travel agent community can help you succeed. The Summer is almost over, now is the time to prepare for the upcoming selling season. Â For more information regarding higher commissions and booking online: www.mailpound.com/BLISS_Intro.HTM For more information about your personal web site: www.mailpound.com/mpdirect To register FREE at MailPound:www.mailpound.com/registration/ Sincerely, Â Bob Maier, President SMART Travel Technologies, Inc. rmaier@smart2000.com 856-983-6100Â Ext. 101 12 East Stow Road, Suite 210 Marlton, New Jersey 08053Â Â Â Â If you do not want to receive these messages in the future, please reply to this message with REMOVE in the subject line.",Act now: Limited time offer,1,0

"Monthly statement available Secondary CD/DVD Image Downloading This is a repost. I just noticed that the original poster asked that it be mirrored to both groups. Since I'm working on it again, I'll add details. It is to be hoped a moderator can delete the earlier, less-complete posting. First, phrasing it in that way sounds hostile with which to begin. This may explain in part the lack of responses. The words ""hoarding"" and ""unnecessary"" are hostile words. Second, there are those of us who are paranoid about net difficulties, or about allowing automated updates. One thinks of *cough* Windows *cough*. It may be unfair, but there it is. The urge for control and backup is deep. Third, when there is nothing at all, not even a simple text file, to explain clearly which need to be downloaded and which *don't* need to be downloaded, a person may feel the need to cautiously download all of them, just in case they are needed. Not providing such details at the point of download violates basic rules for giving instructions. I suggest this, for example: [BEGIN BLOCK] URL: filename: explanation.text actual enclosed text: The following instructions apply to downloading the binary distribution of Debian 4.0r4. If you are new to Debian, do download this file and allow the torrent to finish: debian-40r4-i386-DVD-1.iso.torrent Only download these files and allow their torrents to finish if you wish to have a complete set of all Debian files on DVD. They are not needed, if you plan to allow an installation from the first DVD to automatically find, and download, any further necessary files from the Internet: debian-40r4-i386-DVD-2.iso.torrent debian-40r4-i386-DVD-3.iso.torrent Only download this file and allow the torrent to finish if you have already downloaded an earlier version of Debian 4.0 and wish to have an updated DVD which will bring the older set of DVD diskettes up to date: debian-update-4.0r4-i386-DVD-1.iso.torrent (Please note that if you do not have an earlier version of Debian 4.0, then the above DVD will be useless to you. Also if you have already downloaded a full or partial set of Debian 4.0r4, meaning at least DVD 1, then you won't need the special update DVD diskette). The above instructions assume you are using a properly configured BitTorrent client. [END BLOCK] This was a quick and dirty post. Edit the text as needed for style and clarity, and for CD-R or other media. -- To UNSUBSCRIBE, email to debian-mirrors-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with a subject of ""unsubscribe"". Trouble?
